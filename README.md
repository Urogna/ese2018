# Project 

This year we will build a '*Job Portal*' as a web application where external companies can post their job offers, and university students can apply subsequently to those job postings. We, the course assitants (total 4) will act as **clients** and students will act as **developers**. 

# Project organization

Sstudents/participants will be divided into small groups (each group will have roughly 3-4 students). Each group will build the software independently. One student from each group will act as a Product Owner (PO), to which we will release the requirements. PO will then describe the reqirements to his/her fellow developers.

The total duration for the project is 12 weeks. First 4 weeks will be given to learn technologies and clear concepts, also to start developing. The project will be developed as a series of **features**. For the next 8 weeks, every 2 weeks we will release requirements for one feature. As a result, total 5 features will be built at the end of the project.
